# Assignment 3: Backend Developer Co-op @ TikTok Vancouver ðŸŒŸ

**Welcome aboard! ðŸŽ‰** Youâ€™ve just been hired as a Backend Developer Co-op in Vancouverâ€™s brand-new TikTok office. As the Vancouver team is settling in, theyâ€™ve given you an exciting task: **building an internal hours-tracking and check-in system for employees.** This system will help team members log their working hours and track their productivity.

Hereâ€™s your mission (should you choose to accept it ðŸ˜‰):

### Project Overview ðŸš€

Your goal is to create a backend API for TikTokâ€™s new Employee Hours Tracking System. This API will enable team members to check in, log their hours, update their info, and even remove their profiles if necessary. To make this easier, your manager provided a set of detailed API routes youâ€™ll need to implement in a separate file [ROUTES.md](./ROUTES.md)

### Requirements ðŸ“œ

1. **API Endpoints**: Implement all routes described in [ROUTES.md](./ROUTES.md). This file has everything you need to get startedâ€”detailed descriptions, request parameters, responses, and example outputs for each route.

2. **Data Handling**:
- Use in-memory storage to keep things simple (no database required). Users and their logged hours will be stored in an array.
- Each new user should have an auto-incremented ID for easy identification (1-indexed).

3. **Server Setup**:
- Your API should be built using Node.js with Express.
- All routes must follow RESTful conventions, and CORS should be configured to allow requests from localhost.

4. **Error Handling**: Return appropriate status codes and error messages if a request fails due to invalid data, or if a user doesnâ€™t exist.

5. **Testing**: Make sure each route works as expected with different inputs and edge cases. Jest is recommended for easy testing.


### Grading Rubrics (100 Points)
- Server must implement the 9 routes according to the documentation at [ROUTES.md](./ROUTES.md)
